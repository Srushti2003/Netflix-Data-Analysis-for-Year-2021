The dataset included detailed information such as showId, title, description, director, genre, cast, production country, release date, rating, duration, IMDB score, content type, and the date added on Netflix.

**Key Insights:**
  Genre Popularity: Identified the most popular genres by the number of titles and average IMDB scores.

  Geographical Diversity: Explored content diversity based on production countries.
  Content Quality: Assessed quality through IMDB scores and highlighted top genres and directors.
  Audience Targeting: Examined the distribution of ratings to understand audience focus from family-friendly to mature content.

**Tools and Techniques:**

  This project provided a deeper understanding of Netflixâ€™s content offerings and strategic directions in 2021.
